			<h2>After School Program Aide</h2>

			<p> After school programs are designed to provide additional enrichment in a variety of areas for kids of all ages, from first grade to high school. Although the curriculum varies by school and program, programs typically offer homework help, creative and dramatic activities, sports participation and similar activities. Most programs also emphasize positive interactions with peers and adults. Program aides assist the primary teacher with a number of duties. Although the programs aren't long -- typically one to three hours after school -- they provide great experience on your resume if you decide to become an educator.</p>
			<p> The central role of an after school program aide is to support the teacher's agenda, which requires listening closely to instructions and following them in accordance with school policies. Aides often help teachers with lesson and activity plans, such as taking small children to observe seasonal changes and plant life. They also help with backup plans -- like staying inside to play educational games -- in case of exceptionally low attendance, inclement weather or other events that might force a change in the primary curriculum.</p>
